## Using a Client

### Creating a Client

An `IDgraphClient` can be created with a list of `GrpcChannel` objects. Connecting to multiple Dgraph servers in the same cluster allows for better distribution of workload.

The following code snippet shows just one connection.

```c#
using Dgraph;
using Grpc.Net.Client;

GrpcChannel channel = GrpcChannel.ForAddress("http://localhost:9080");
using var dgraphClient = DgraphClient.Create(channel);
```

The connection can be configured by using `GrpcChannelOptions`.

```c#
using Grpc.Net.Client;

var options = new GrpcChannelOptions
{
    CompressionProviders = <...>, // List of Grpc ICompressionProvider
    Credentials = Grpc.Core.ChannelCredentials.Create(<...>)
};
GrpcChannel channel = GrpcChannel.ForAddress("http://localhost:9080", options);
```

### Login into a namespace

If your server has Access Control Lists enabled (Dgraph v1.1 or above), the client must be logged in for accessing data. Use `Login` to obtain and remember access and refresh JWTs.

```c#
var result = await dgraphClient.Login("user", "password");
if (result.IsFailed)
{
    // Handle errors
}
```

All subsequent operations via the logged in client will send along the stored access token.

If your server additionally has namespaces (Dgraph v21.03 or above), use `LoginIntoNamespace`.

```c#
var result = await dgraphClient.LoginIntoNamespace("user", "password", 0x10);
if (result.IsFailed)
{
    // Handle errors
}
```

### Connecting To Dgraph Cloud

Use `DgraphCloudChannel.Create(ENDPOINT, API_KEY)` to create a GrpcChannel that connects to a Dgraph Cloud backend.

`DgraphCloudChannel.Create()` can accept GraphQL or gRPC URIs from [Dgraph Cloud](https://cloud.dgraph.io/), but it will always connect via gRPC.

```c#
using Dgraph;
using Grpc.Net.Client;

string ENDPOINT = "<...>";
string API_KEY = "<...>";

GrpcChannel channel = DgraphCloudChannel.Create(ENDPOINT, API_KEY);
using var dgraphClient = DgraphClient.Create(channel);
```


### Altering the Database

To set the schema, create an instance of `Dgraph.Api.Operation` and use the `Alter` endpoint.

```c#
using Dgraph;

var operation = new Api.Operation {
    Schema = "name: string @index(exact) ."
};
var result = dgraphClient.Alter(operation);
if (result.IsFailed)
{
    // Handle errors
}
```
`Operation` contains other fields as well, including `DropAttr` and `DropAll`. `DropAll` is useful if you wish to discard all the data without bringing the instance down. `DropAttr` is used to drop all the data related to a predicate.

Starting in Dgraph version 20.03.0, indexes can be computed in the background. You can set the `RunInBackground` field to `true` like so:

```c#
using Dgraph;

var operation = new Api.Operation {
    Schema = "name: string @index(exact) .",
    RunInBackground = true
};
var result = dgraphClient.Alter(operation);
if (result.IsFailed)
{
    // Handle errors
}
```

### Creating a Transaction

To create a transaction, call the `IDgraphClient.NewTransaction` method, which returns a new `Transaction` object. This operation incurs no network overhead.

To ensure the `Transaction` is properly disposed after it has completed, use the `using` keyword.

```c#
using var transaction = dgraphClient.NewTransaction();
var transactionResponse = await transaction.Mutate(...);
var result = await transaction.Commit();
```

Read-only transactions can be created by calling the `IDgraphClient.NewReadOnlyTransaction` method. Read-only transactions are useful to increase read speed because they can circumvent the usual consensus protocol. Read-only transactions cannot contain mutations. There is nothing to dispose for a `ReadOnlyTransaction` object, so it does not implement `IDisposable`.
```c#
var readOnlyTransaction = dgraphClient.NewReadOnlyTransaction();
var result = await readOnlyTransaction.Query(...);
```




### Running a Mutation

`Transaction.Mutate(RequestBuilder)` runs a mutation. It takes in a json mutation string.

We define a person object to represent a person and serialize it to a json mutation string. In this example, we are using the [JSON.NET](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json) library, but you can use any JSON serialization library you prefer.

```c#
using(var txn = client.NewTransaction()) {
    var alice = new Person{ Name = "Alice" };
    var json = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(alice);
    
    var transactionResult = await txn.Mutate(new RequestBuilder().WithMutations(new MutationBuilder{ SetJson = json }));
}
```

You can also set mutations using RDF format, if you so prefer, as seen below:

```c#
var mutation = "_:alice <name> \"Alice\"";
var transactionResult = await txn.Mutate(new RequestBuilder().WithMutations(new MutationBuilder{ SetNquads = mutation }));
```

Check out the example in `source/Dgraph.tests.e2e/TransactionTest.cs`.





# OLD DOCS

<!-- Make a new client by passing in one or more GRPC channels pointing to alphas.

```c#
var uri = new Uri("http://127.0.0.1:9080");
var options = new GrpcChannelOptions
{
    Credentials = ChannelCredentials.Insecure
};
var client = new DgraphClient(GrpcChannel.ForAddress(uri, options));
```
 -->
<!-- 
### Altering the Database

To set the schema, pass the schema into the `DgraphClient.Alter` function, as seen below:

```c#
var schema = "name: string @index(exact) .";
var result = client.Alter(new Operation{ Schema = schema });
```

The returned result object is based on the FluentResults library. You can check the status using `result.isSuccess` or `result.isFailed`. More information on the result object can be found [here](https://github.com/altmann/FluentResults). -->

<!-- 
### Creating a Transaction

To create a transaction, call `DgraphClient.NewTransaction` method, which returns a
new `Transaction` object. This operation incurs no network overhead.

It is good practice to call to wrap the `Transaction` in a `using` block, so that the `Transaction.Dispose` function is called after running
the transaction. 

```c#
using(var transaction = client.NewTransaction()) {
    ...
}
```

You can also create Read-Only transactions. Read-Only transactions only allow querying, and can be created using `DgraphClient.NewReadOnlyTransaction`. -->


<!-- ### Running a Mutation

`Transaction.Mutate(RequestBuilder)` runs a mutation. It takes in a json mutation string.

We define a person object to represent a person and serialize it to a json mutation string. In this example, we are using the [JSON.NET](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json) library, but you can use any JSON serialization library you prefer.

    var json = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(alice);
    
    var transactionResult = await txn.Mutate(new RequestBuilder().WithMutations(new MutationBuilder{ SetJson = json }));
}
```

var transactionResult = await txn.Mutate(new RequestBuilder().WithMutations(new MutationBuilder{ SetNquads = mutation }));
```

Check out the example in `source/Dgraph.tests.e2e/TransactionTest.cs`. -->

### Running a Query

You can run a query by calling `Transaction.Query(string)`. You will need to pass in a
GraphQL+- query string. If you want to pass an additional map of any variables that
you might want to set in the query, call `Transaction.QueryWithVars(string, Dictionary<string,string>)` with
the variables dictionary as the second argument.

The response would contain the response string.

Letâ€™s run the following query with a variable $a:

```console
query all($a: string) {
  all(func: eq(name, $a))
  {
    name
  }
}
```

Run the query, deserialize the result from Uint8Array (or base64) encoded JSON and
print it out:

```c#
// Run query.
var query = @"query all($a: string) {
  all(func: eq(name, $a))
  {
    name
  }
}";

var vars = new Dictionary<string,string> { { "$a", "Alice" } };
var res = await dgraphClient.NewReadOnlyTransaction().QueryWithVars(query, vars);

// Print results.
Console.Write(res.Value.Json);
```

### Running an Upsert: Query + Mutation

The `Transaction.Mutate` function allows you to run upserts consisting of one query and one mutation. 

To know more about upsert, we highly recommend going through the docs at https://docs.dgraph.io/mutations/#upsert-block.

```c#
var query = @"
  query {
    user as var(func: eq(email, ""wrong_email@dgraph.io""))
  }";

var mutation = new MutationBuilder{ SetNquads = "uid(user) <email> \"correct_email@dgraph.io\" ." };

var request = new RequestBuilder{ Query = query, CommitNow = true }.withMutation(mutation);

// Upsert: If wrong_email found, update the existing data
// or else perform a new mutation.
await txn.Mutate(request);
```

### Committing a Transaction

A transaction can be committed using the `Transaction.Commit` method. If your transaction
consisted solely of calls to `Transaction.Query` or `Transaction.QueryWithVars`, and no calls to
`Transaction.Mutate`, then calling `Transaction.Commit` is not necessary.

An error will be returned if other transactions running concurrently modify the same
data that was modified in this transaction. It is up to the user to retry
transactions when they fail.

```c#
using(var txn = client.NewTransaction()) {
    var result = txn.Commit();
}
```


### Setting Metadata Headers

Metadata headers such as authentication tokens can be set through the `options` of gRPC methods. Below is an example of how to set a header named "auth-token".

```c#
var metadata = new Metadata
{
    { "auth-token", "the-auth-token-value" }
};

var options = new CallOptions(headers: metadata);

client.Alter(op, options)
```

<!-- ### Connecting To Dgraph Cloud Endpoint

Please use the following snippet to connect to a Dgraph Cloud GraphQL or Dgraph Cloud backend.


```c#
var client = new DgraphClient(DgraphCloudChannel.Create("frozen-mango.grpc.eu-central-1.aws.cloud.dgraph.io", "<api-key>"));
```
> Note that you should use the gRPC URI when using the Cloud. -->

<!-- ### Login to Namespace

Please use the following snippet to connect to a Dgraph Cloud GraphQL or Dgraph Cloud backend.


```c#
var lr = new Api.LoginRequest() {
  UserId = "userId",
  Password = "password",
  Namespace = 0
}

client.Login(lr)
``` -->
